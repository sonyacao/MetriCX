12:44PM|11/07/19|@ChindyChatwell|As mentioned, wasn't initially sure if I would take advantage of this benefit through Great-West Life. These unbiased media reviewers clinched it for me: @oharaclare(Globe & Mail), @clabrow (Macleans) @ingridlunden(TechCrunch) and @isabelle_kirk(BetaKit)
8:44PM|11/04/19|@cherylannmc|One of my favourite things to do - share experiences and ideas.  "HR Impact in 2020" with  David Loree from Ivey, Mark Wilson from Loblaw, and Grace Palombo from Great West Life.    Well worth the drive to Muskoka (even through snow and sleet!)
6:59PM|11/03/19|@paulterrett82|Simply put. What happened to me should never have happened. Then m... The treatment from WorkSafe. The treatment from Morneau Shapell. The treatment from great West Life. Hurry up and get back to a job that absolutely terrifies you to your core now.
11:56AM|11/03/19|@profharbringer|As a Canadian I can tell you this is technically true but VERY misleading. I have Great West Life extended medical insurance through my job. This doesn't cover my hospital or doctor's visits. My mandatory govt healthcare dies that. I walk into an emergency room and hand them‚Ä¶

My union, WorkSafe, everyone spent months on me paying back great West Life twice. Which is insanity because I paid them. I reimbursed them with the great West Life case worker on
10:46PM|10/28/19|@jeromeleoterry|I did take advantage of Best Doctors through Great West Life. I have a 30 page report to hand to the neurologist, whenever I get into see him

2:00PM|10/25/19|@ForwomenSfuture|Great West Life is refusing to pay for desiccated thyroid meds in any form because the BC List does not cover it.  The chemical form, synthroid, does not work well with me and many others.  Why is it not on the BC list of medications and what can I do about this.  HELP!
5:45PM|10/24/19|@paulterrett82|But WorkSafe immediately said "that doesn't matter" and dismissed that entire part of my claim. I went a long time before great West Life kicked in and then they fought like hell to get me to pay them twice. Then great West Life ended and I had to wait for WorkSafe.

7:36PM|08/10/19|@cmlongtin|@fordnation I went to the Ministry of Labor with my case against Great West Life. Yasir Navqi, Minister. I received no assistance. Who was covering Great West Life and the harassment and discrimination I reported. He is now with the Feds. Great West attempted to retire me today.
7:10PM|08/10/19|@cmlongtin|@fordnation Today, Great West Life attempted to retire me without severance or vacation pay. The FSCO did nothing but attempt to send me to the Ombudsman. The departments are covering their own Liberals. It needs to be cleaned up. It likely will need massive audits. How long?

8:42PM|09/24/19|@cmlongtin|@RickChiarelli Having been through something similar, I can say my doctor (Jabouin) recommended a gradual return to work and Great West Life terminated my employment.
